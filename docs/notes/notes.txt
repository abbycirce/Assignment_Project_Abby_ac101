Ideas:
1. A Map that pinpoints each coffee shop on campus that a student could study at
2. A Rate/Review system so students can keep track of which spots they liked or did not like
3. A potential study page where lofi music plays while they work?

Wireframes:
- I sketched a menu page with an image of a coffee mug with a foam art location pointer in the middle, along with the rest of the pages at the top
- I made a frame for the map, and a search bar at the top
- I also made a page for users to go back to the shops they have visited before and see what their overall thoughts and rating were about the shop

Branching Strategy:
I decided on a GitHub branching strategy because it is best suited for a smaller team. Since it is just me working on this project, this simple, easy approach to branching will be best

Branch Usage Reflections:
Because I save and push my progress after every step, I did not realize we were supposed to wait until we created the new branch to push our wireframe pictures and notes. Therefore, I am not sure if that data ended up in the test branch. However, the process of creating and switching between branches was very smooth.

Django Set Up:
I used Assignment_Project_Abby_ac101 as my project folder name because that was what it automatically set to when I made this project. I tried changing it so it was differeny, but I had some problems pushing when that happened. I will seek help on how to successfully change the name of the folder.
Set up went very smooth, and I was able to open the link to my web application
